GUIDELINES TO FOLLOW WHEN REPORTING:

Please be aware that Solder is intended for experienced server admins only, and so it is
expected that you've at least tried to research an issue before reporting it.

Note that Windows is not officially supported. (Though some community members may help)

Please try to be respectful when reporting an issue. We understand that bugs are
frustrating, but getting mad will only make it harder to fix.
