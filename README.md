What is Solder?
--------------

Technic Solder is an API that sits between a modpack repository and the launcher. It allows you to easily manage multiple modpacks in one single location. It's the same API we use to distribute our modpacks!

Using Solder also means your packs will download each mod individually. This means the launcher can check MD5's against each version of a mod and if it hasn't changed, use the cached version of the mod instead. What does this mean? Small incremental updates to your modpack doesn't mean redownloading the whole thing every time!

Solder also interfaces with the Technic Platform using an API key you can generate through your account there. When Solder has this key it can directly interact with your Platform account. When creating new modpacks you will be able to import any packs you have registered in your Solder install. It will also create detailed mod lists on your Platform page! (assuming you have the respective data filled out in Solder). Neat huh?

Installation/Updating Solder
-------------

Refer to our documentation here: <https://docs.solder.io/>

If there is any missing/incorrect info, please post an issue on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/TechnicPack/TechnicSolder/issues)

Using Docker
-------------

Docker can make managing your instance of Solder easier. To get started, you will need to install Docker and Docker Compose to your host system. You will also need to have this repo cloned. Here's an [example for Ubuntu 22.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-22-04). Follow the instructions below from the cloned directory:

Build the Solder Docker image.
```bash
docker build --no-cache -t solder -f ./docker/Dockerfile .
```

Run the setup to prepare your instance. You might need to modify `start.sh` to disable setting a new app key if you already have one. Make sure not to run this more than once unless you want a new app key.
```bash
docker-compose -f compose-setup.yml up setup
```

Finally, you can turn on your instance of Solder.
```bash
docker-compose up -d --remove-orphans
```

(The `--remove-orphans` flag is necessary to remove the container used in the setup.)

Refer to the [Docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/) for more information about how to use it.
